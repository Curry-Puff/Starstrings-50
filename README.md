# STRINGSTARS 50

Hello everyone, my name is Anirudh Thumma and this is my CS50 final project!


* This is a platformer and so all you need to do to win is to just reach the end
* There are a lot of pits and floating platforms in the game so you need to jump a lot
* Also be careful not to jump from too high up 
---
**CONTROLS**
---
* The *left and right arrow keys* to move left and right respectively
* The *SPACE BAR* to jump
